# Projects

Code for India (CFI) currently facilitates more than 10 projects. There are many more projects put forward by our NGO Partners and projects that take root from our Hackathons.

## Requirements

To efficiently manage and track progress on a Project, we need to aggregate a lot of information from the Project Teams. The data collected from teams helps us accelerate the growth of the project, track progress through metrics, allow transparency to NGO partners etc. All of these form a very important part for efficient project management.

Please look at the list of issues created to help us develop the features needed in this area.
