# Code for India - Events

Code for India (CFI) hosts multiple events through the year. The most recurring event is our Weekly Meetups. We also host Hackathons and participate in various other Non-profit events in the Bay Area.

## Weekly Meetups
Our Weekly Meetups are the platform for our members to meet on a regular basis and dedicate time to the project they are working on. We provide lunch and a "get things done" environment. Once a month, we have scheduled orientation for new members who join CFI.

## Hackathons
Our first Hackathon was hosted at Stanford in October,2013. Our second Hackathon was a Global Event, hosted in May 2014. Both our hackathons have been immensely successful and have helped us build a great community.

## Requirements

To manage multiple events, we need an efficient way to collect information about members and participants. This helps us in arranging logistics for the event (eg: Food, Schwag etc.). Please look at the list of issues created to help us develop the features needed in this area.
