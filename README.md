# Code for India (CFI)
The Central Web Application for CFI Core Team


Code for India (CFI) is a Non-Profit Organization aimed at facilitating projects between our NGO Partners and Community Members. We harness the collective efforts of the community to create solutions for the NGOs that work on the ground.

In this project you will find the four main modules that the CFI Core Team needs in order to work more efficiently on a daily basis. As with any startup, we started with the most basic and free tools available. But in the last few months we have grown and we need to connect our systems better to work at scale and also allow more growth.

## How to work through this project?
* Each folder marks a separate work area for each of the modules. Please check-in your work under the right folder.
* Each module has a README that gives the basic functionality expected from the module.
* You can find a list of tasks associated with each module under the ISSUES section. If you start working on a task, please assign it to yourself. This is prevent duplication of work by other members and we will get more done.
