# Profiles

Code for India (CFI) has more than 500 members that work on different projects. Members are geographically distributed all over the world and have a varied background and set of skills. The only thing common is their passion to help a good cause.

## Requirements

To help facilitate recruitment of a team for each Project, CFI needs to know a lot more about its members and help connect them more effectively. Instead of taking the approach of filling out a very long form, we want to retrieve all the useful information from the existing services our members use. The following is the list of services and the type of data that we to retrieve for each of our members.

1. LinkedIn - Organization, Title, Skills
2. Facebook - Location, Event Participation
3. Github - Programming Languages, Projects, Contributions

Please look at the list of issues created to help us develop the features needed in this area.
